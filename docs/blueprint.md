## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of trust and professionalism, in keeping with a dark color scheme.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), close to black but not as severe, allowing content to pop.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), an analogous hue to the primary that's brighter and more saturated, for highlighting interactive elements and important data points.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) may be used for code snippets if included in feedback.
- Use a consistent style of minimalist, line-based icons to represent different satisfaction metrics and data visualizations. The icons should be primarily white, to contrast against the dark background.
- Design a clean, modern dashboard layout with clear data hierarchies and intuitive navigation. Utilize card-based design to organize information effectively.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement without distracting from the data. For example, use animated charts and graphs to display trends and changes in satisfaction levels.
